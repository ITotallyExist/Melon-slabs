Make sure gradle can compile without build error, otherwise all the errors you are getting are irrelevant to the actual code because its using an older version of minecraft or something

important to go to vscode extensions -> gradle -> settings -> open settings.json and make sure java_home is pointing to jdk 21

make sure you ran ./gradlew vscode
and ./gradlew gensources

try running ./gradlew clean
and ./gradlew --refresh-dependencies 
^
especially if updating rei version, for example

restart your computer if it ever says resources are busy

delete everything in /users/greg/.gradle/caches

notes from fabricmc site:


Importing a project
Clone the project into a folder and then open the folder in Visual Studio Code. The IDE should then start importing the Gradle project (if it does not start after about 30 seconds, open the build.gradle file).


Generating run configurations
 Next, run ./gradlew vscode - this will automatically generate the necessary launch.json file containing the run configs.


Generating minecraft source
If you want to browse the Minecraft source you can use the Gradle genSources task. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal ./gradlew genSources.

refresh your Java project, 
this can be done by pressing Shift + Alt + U while having the build.gradle file open.
